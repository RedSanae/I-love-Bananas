A short write-up in the README file:
The roles/tasks that each member has in the project

Ricky create the date format. Kevin decide to make everything else. Ricky tried to push, but Kevin said "Nah I'd win", and he created all of the parts...

The challenges of the project and how to overcome the problems; tell me whether your group enjoys collaborative coding or not, why or why not? Explain

The one and only problem we had in this assignment is when we couldn't get our code to sync with each ohter. We took 3 class trying to figure why is it not syncing. Until Ricky figured that Kevin stole his code (forked my code).
